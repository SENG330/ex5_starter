# Total:  / 15

# Depth of insight and novelty (0-5). 
- [ ] 5 - novel solution that demonstrates breadth of analysis.
- [ ] 4 - expected solution, well put together.
- [ ] 3 - missing some key components or lacks depth.
- [ ] 2 - missing many aspects; lacks insight and work.
- [ ] 1 - little evidence of design; mostly missing components.
- [ ] 0 - not handed in or not available.

# Proper use of tests and actions (0-5).

- [ ] 5 - Expanded use of actions and integration testing, above what was required. 
- [ ] 4 - clear separation of integration and unit testing. Github Actions work. Manual testing can be triggered. All tests pass.
- [ ] 3 - mostly complete but gaps or inconsistencies in the Actions or tests. E.g. tests that fail, tests with poor names, etc.
- [ ] 2 - missing many aspects; lacks insight and work. E.g. no working integration test, partial testing only. 
- [ ] 1 - little evidence of work; mostly missing components.
- [ ] 0 - not handed in or not available. 0 for no tests. 

# Code correctness and understanding of Java concepts (0-5)
- [ ] 5 - A 4, plus insight into the problem beyond the problem description, or identifies key problems.
- [ ] 4 - A 3, plus evidence of use of textbook constructs to date.
- [ ] 3 - All Java code well written and commented. Unit tests exist. Gradle file works.
- [ ] 2 - Code does not compile or not possible to run. Missing many aspects; lacks insight and evidence of work.
- [ ] 1 - Does not compile. Little evidence of work; mostly missing components.
- [ ] 0 - not handed in or not available. 

## Bonus

- 1 or 2 marks with respect to using Guice. 1 mark for demonstrating (i.e., working) one feature of Guice (e.g. @Bind). 2 marks for showing 2 or more such uses. No marks for partial / not useful solutions. Be sure to explain in the ADR what is going on.
